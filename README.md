# Haskell Bake + Kubernetes CI/CD

This code contains the relevant files as discussed in my blog post http://brian.uncannyworks.com/posts/2016-12-09-haskell-bake-and-kubernetes.html as well as the addition of a `BuildDocker` command and small changes to support it.

It has been cleaned up and generalized a little further, although a potential forker will still want to make some heavy modifications in order to get their complete environment working correctly.
